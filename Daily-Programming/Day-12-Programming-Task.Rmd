Today, you're going to generate simulated data to test out LDA and QDA.

You'll make two data sets, each of which will have two classes of outcomes: `"red"`, and `"blue`"

* `SameSigma` where cases in the two classes have the same covariance matrix for the predictor variables.
* `DifferentSigma` where the two classes have different covariance matrices.

# Generating simulated data

* Create an object `n_cases` with the value 100.
* Create an object `red_mean` with the value `c(1, 0)`.
* Create an object `green_mean` with value `c(0, -1)`.
* Create an object `blue_mean` with value `c(-1, 1)`.
* Create an object `covar_1` which is a 2 x 2 matrix with 3 and 1 on the diagonal and $-1.7$ on the off-diagonal. It should be structured as a covariance matrix.
* Similarly, create an object `covar_2`, a covariance matrix with 2 and 3 on the diagonal and $1.5$ on the off-diagonal.
* Create three matrices, `one`, `two`, and `three`.  Each should have the appropriate shape for data from `n_cases` cases and two variables. The variables should each be `n_cases` random draws from a $\mbox{N}(0, 1^2)$ distribution, that is, a normal distribution with mean zero and standard deviation $1$.\marginnote[-2cm]{In specifying the normal distribution, one needs to decide whether to report the standard deviation or the variance.  R uses \texttt{sd=}.  To help to eliminate ambiguity in mathematical notation, the form $1^2$ is used simply as a reminder that the quantity is a variance.}
* Create an matrix `red` that is `one` times the Cholesky decomposition of `covar_1`.  The `red` matrix will contain correlated random variables with a covariance of approximately `covar_1`.
* Similarly, create a matrix `green` which will be `two` times the Cholesky decomposition of `covar_1`.
* Also create a matrix `blue` which will be `three` times the Cholesky decomposition of the other covariance matrix, `covar_2`.
* Modify the `red`, `green` and `blue` matrices by adding to each column a value for the mean drawn from `red_mean`, `green_mean`, and `blue_mean` respectively.\marginnote[-2.5cm]{{\em Hint}: It won't work to do the obvious, simple thing, e.g.  add \texttt{red\_mean} to \texttt{red}. There are many ways to construct a statement that works.  Among others, there's a way using \texttt{outer()}, a way using \texttt{matrix()}, and even a way using \texttt{t()} twice.} That is, for `red`, add 1 to the first column and 0 to the second.

\newpage

* Create three data frames, each with variables `x`, `y`, and `class`.\marginnote{You'll use \texttt{data.frame()} to construct the data frames.  Make sure to give the optional argument \texttt{stringsAsFactors = FALSE}.  This will let the class be stored as straightforward character strings that can be used in plotting to specify the color.} 
    - `Red` will have `x` as the first column of `red`, `y` as the second column of `red`, and `class` set equal to the string "red".
    - `Blue` will be the same thing but using the columns of `blue` and the `class` set to `"blue"`
    - `Green` is similar, using the columns of `green` and the class `"green"`.
* Last step in generating the simulated data: make two data frames each of which combines "data" from two classes.
```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
Sim_one <- rbind(Red, Green)
Sim_two <- rbind(Red, Blue)
```

```{r echo=show_answers}
n_cases <- 10000
red_mean <- c(1, 0)
green_mean <- c(0, -1)
blue_mean <- c(-1, 1)
covar_1 <- matrix(c(3, -1.7, -1.7, 2), nrow=2, ncol=2)
covar_2 <- matrix(c(2, 1.5, 1.5, 3), nrow=2, ncol=2)
one <- matrix(rnorm(2 * n_cases), ncol=2, nrow=n_cases)
# other ways to do this
#       cbind(rnorm(n_cases), rnorm(n_cases))
#       matrix(rnorm(2 * n_cases), ncol=2)
two <- matrix(rnorm(2 * n_cases), ncol=2)
three <- matrix(rnorm(2 * n_cases), ncol=2, nrow=n_cases)
red <- one %*% chol(covar_1) + outer(rep(1, n_cases), red_mean)
# Another way to generate the matrix to the right of +
#      matrix(red_mean, nrow = n_cases, ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE)
green <- two %*% chol(covar_1) + outer(rep(1, n_cases), green_mean)
blue <- three %*% chol(covar_2) + outer(rep(1, n_cases), blue_mean)
Red <- data.frame(x = red[,1], y = red[,2], class="red", 
                  stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
Green <- data.frame(x = green[,1], y = green[,2], class="green",
                    stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
Blue <- data.frame(x = blue[,1], y = blue[,2], class="blue",
                   stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
Sim_one <- rbind(Red, Green)
Sim_two <- rbind(Red, Blue)
```
```{r echo=show_answers, fig.margin=TRUE, eval=show_answers, fig.height=5, fig.width=5,out.width="2.5in"}
plot(y ~ x, data=Sim_one, col=alpha(Sim_one$class, .02), pch=20)
```
```{r echo=show_answers, fig.margin=TRUE, , fig.height=5, fig.width=5,out.width="2.5in", fig.cap="The two classes of cases, red and blue, in \\texttt{Sim\\_two}."}
plot(y ~ x, data=Sim_two, col=alpha(Sim_two$class, .02), pch=20)
```

# LDA and QDA

Fit a linear discriminant model `class ~ x + y` to the data in `Sim_one`. Call the model `mod_LDA_one`.
```{r echo=TRUE}
mod_LDA_one <- MASS::lda(class ~ x + y, data = Sim_one)
```

Then use the model to test the model on the same training data to which it was fit. Store the result in `test_LDA_one`.
```{r echo=TRUE}
test_LDA_one <- predict(mod_LDA_one, newdata = Sim_one)
```

The resulting object, `test_LDA_one`,  is a list of three items. Make sure you understand what each of them is.

QDA works in the same way: the function is `qda()`.

# Confusion matrices

The confusion matrix compares the actual class to the predicted class from the model.  It's straightforward to compute:
```{r echo=TRUE, eval=show_answers}
table(Sim_one$class, test_LDA_one$class)
```

* Compare the confusion matrix from LDA on `Sim_one` to that from QDA on `Sim_one`.^[Use the names `mod_QDA_one` and `test_QDA_one` to store the fitted model and the test results from `predict()` respectively.]  Which one shows better performance?
```{r echo=show_answers, eval=show_answers}
mod_QDA_one <- MASS::qda(class ~ x + y, data = Sim_one)
test_QDA_one <- predict(mod_QDA_one, newdata = Sim_one)
table(Sim_one$class, test_QDA_one$class)
```

* Fit both LDA and QDA models to `Sim_two`.  Which one performs better?
```{r echo=show_answers, eval=show_answers}
mod_LDA_two <- MASS::lda(class ~ x + y, data = Sim_two)
mod_QDA_two <- MASS::qda(class ~ x + y, data = Sim_two)
test_LDA_two <- predict(mod_LDA_two, newdata = Sim_two)
test_QDA_two <- predict(mod_QDA_two, newdata = Sim_two)
table(Sim_two$class, test_LDA_two$class)
table(Sim_two$class, test_QDA_two$class)
```

# Bigger n

The difference in performance of LDA and QDA in these examples is not so large that it's evident in a sample with 100 cases of each class.  Go back and set `n_cases` to be 10000, and re-evaluate the confusion matrices.

# Above and beyond

Calculate the log likelihood for `mod_LDA_one` against the observations `Sim_one$class`.

```{r echo=show_answers, eval=show_answers}
likelihoods <-
  with(test_LDA_one, 
       ifelse(class == "red", posterior[,"red"], posterior[,"green"]))
sum(log(likelihoods))
```


```{r echo=FALSE, eval=show_answers, results="asis"}
cat("# Test statments")
```

```{r echo=show_answers, eval=show_answers}
source("Day-12-Test-Statements.R")
