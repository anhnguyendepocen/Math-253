A book with three chapters that relate nicely to STAT 253.

Objects: Use Hadley's example from install_github("hadley/rv2") --- various functions for working with discrete random variables.

* [rvest](https://github.com/hadley/rvest) for data scraping ???

## Federalist Papers

See <https://github.com/rudeboybert/Federalist> where they look at a set of key words and the odds ratio of using them by Hamilton compared to Jay and Madison.

* Word counting and odds ratios
* Identification of important words.
