A book with three chapters that relate nicely to STAT 253.

Objects: Use Hadley's example from install_github("hadley/rv2") --- various functions for working with discrete random variables.

* [rvest](https://github.com/hadley/rvest) for data scraping ???

## Federalist Papers

See <https://github.com/rudeboybert/Federalist> where they look at a set of key words and the odds ratio of using them by Hamilton compared to Jay and Madison.

Could be two projects, maybe done in reverse order from the web site:

* Word counting and odds ratios
* Identification of important words.
