The *ISL* book adopts a style of programming that is not as concise as desired.

## Kinds of Objects in R

1. Data tables (a.k.a. data frames)
2. variables
3. vectors
4. functions
5. arguments
6. scalars & constants
7. formulas

How to identify each of them.

## Plotting systems

There are three widely used plotting systems in R: base graphics, lattice graphics, `ggplot2` graphics.  We're going to be using some of all three.  It's not that they do different things. But you will see materials written in all three and each of the three involves a distinct programming style. 

How to spot base graphics.  Adding layers

How to spot lattice.  Hard to add layers



## Attach

In *ISL* they use the `attach()` function.  **Never** use `attach()`.  If you are using `attach()`, something is wrong and you can find a better way.
